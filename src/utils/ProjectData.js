Gender and the female form will be the prime factor in Eve’s discerns thus ambitions, towards godhead and fall to temptation. Eve will be the archetype to the female form in ensuing readings of John Donne and Thomas Wyatt.', image: mazyErrorImage, paragraphOneTitle: 'In Utero', paragraphOneContents: 'Eve is the nurturer and nutrient to the continuity of the human race. A womb of nourishment and maternal instinct is what will differentiate Eve’s thought processes to Adam’s. Eve’s womb and maternal instinct is what will be impressed upon her as a creation of God, thus Eve’s mind will be vexed to understand if her oocytes are in gravitation towards God or Adam harnessing God. This vexing is evident as Eve finds temptation in a non-human creation of God equal to a phallic symbol, “O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear / To that false worm” (IX. 1067-1068). Adam gives a sort of warning to Eve of what direction to gravitate, “for nothing lovelier can be found / In woman, than to study household good, / And good works in her husband to promote.” (IX. 232-234); household can indeed equivocate to womb which houses an infant, as Adam is exclaiming to Eve to take care of herself and trust in her ‘husband’. Eve’s vexations continue after Eve eats the fruit, “shall I to him make known / As yet my change, and give him to partake / Full happiness with me, or rather not,” (IX. 817-819). “O fairest of creation, last and best / Of all God’s works, creature in whom excelled / Whatever can to sight or thought be formed” (IX. 896-898); In Adam’s dialog to Eve after eating the fruit, Milton leaves words very open to equivocation: “Whatever can to sight or thought be formed”. Adam could very well be identifying a creature in Eve, an oocyte and thus the utmost importance to the continuity of the species, as a work of God. And that Eve gave whatever thought to be formed as her choice to gravitate towards God over Adam, two patriarchal figures.', paragraphTwoTitle: 'Eve and Archetype to the Female Form', paragraphTwoContents: 'After Eve bites the fruit, Eve is in dialog with God and yet herself to, “O sovereign, virtuous, precious of all trees” (IX. 795). Eve has a very impassioned moment with God and herself, directly after eating the fruit, with intellectual insights and plots. Eve enters into some sort of scheming mode as to “dieted by thee I grow mature / In knowledge, as the gods”, and is yet ambitious to “keep the odds of knowledge in my power” void of Adam. Yet Eve resolves that, she will become useless thus extinct if she avoids Adam, “I extinct; / a death to think. Confirmed then I resolve, / Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe” (IX. 829-831). God as the ingenuity of Eve’s ovaries and maternal nature—gives Eve impulsive instincts, against God’s wishes, to be God’s associate sole yet needing Adam to survive. This schematic of Eve, hence female form, is reflexive to the female form in Sir Thomas Wyatt’s poem ‘They Flee From Me’: “To take bread at my hand; and now they range, / Busily seeking with a continual change.”. This idea of ‘taking bread at my hand’ can equivocate to her survival; a brief moment of touching then sudden range defines a tangential function, and is all similar to Eve’s schematic. This reference to a ‘mathematical tangent’ gives note, to the sinews of the female figure’s intellect.', paragraphThreeTitle: 'Surveillance', paragraphThreeContents: 'Eve will assume some righteous power upon Adam, whilst understanding the grave importance of her womb, as if holding her oocytes hostage for ransom to negotiate control, “so to add what wants / In female sex, the more to draw his love, And render me more equal, and perhaps, / A thing not undesirable, sometime / Superior” (IX. 821-825). Eve will want some type of governance upon Adam, as God does; this symmetry of behavior to God by Eve, to govern Adam, is evident as Eve wanting to be ‘rendered more equal’ meaning more symmetrical to God. This ‘becoming’ of the male figure to a pawn like state, gives surveillance to the male figure’s freedom perplexed. Adam is obliged by God to secure Eve and procure the human race, while Eve governs Adam as God does. “In thin array after a pleasant guise...Therewithall sweetly did me kiss / And softly said, “Dear heart, how like you this?””(10, 13-14); the female figure’s actions of intercourse, are in elevation to maintain relevance to God whilst utilizing control and surveillance tactics to govern. “But all is turned thorough my gentleness / Into a strange fashion of forsaking; / And I have leave to go of her goodness, / And she also, to use newfangleness.” (16-19). Wyatt’s temperance in ‘I have leave to go of her goodness’, sounds as though a submissive stance, to the goodness of procuring the species yet still a pawn to the female form. Wyatt’s concavity between a gentleness seduced towards the female form and an abrupt feeling of being forsaken, in the sake of ‘newfangleness’, is a tangential surveillance. Thomas Wyatt will identify the female figure’s sinful gravitation to God, as ‘newfangleness’. This box of surveillance and schematics will ultimately vex the male form and poet, rendering an image of escape, for instance: “This flea is you and I” (12).', paragraphFourTitle: 'Losse of Maidenhead', paragraphFourContents: '“And in this flea, our two bloods mingled bee; / Thou know’st that this cannot be said / A sinne, nor shame, nor losse of maidenhead,” (4-6); Donne notes the mechanical essence of the flea, hence not prone to vexation, as a comparison to the loss of maidenhead. Donne notes the intellectual vexations of the female form, in relation to sin. As Donne acquires an auxiliary free-object of which is non-human, to explore away from the female form, an erection occurs: “Yet this enjoyes before it wooe, / And pamper’d swells with one blood made of two,” (7-8); ‘pamper’d swells with one blood made of two’ will identify as an erection. This supreme anecdote, that escaping the female form would give Donne an erection, is insight to a new personal freedom. A personal freedom from the maidenhead governance, thus to escape the perpetuity of Eve’s sin, schematic, and surveillance. A flea alone acts tangentially, with hunting stratagem to seek blood, and infers a transitive property of the female form; yet, Donne will adorn the flea as since acting in respect to God. Donne finds affection to a creature of God acting tangentially, except legally, to cure his vexations of pondering the irregular tangent of the female, “’Tis true, then learne how false, feares bee; / Just so much honor, when thou yeeld’st to mee,” (25-26).', paragraphFiveTitle: 'Conclusion', paragraphFiveContents: 'Ultimately, Eve’s mental vexations to the patriarch of her oocytes induce ‘mazy error’. Eve’s idea to hold her oocytes hostage with ransom to govern Adam, “Of operation blessed / To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed, / And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end Created” (IX. 796-799), hath given complexity to Adam’s personal freedom of obliging God. An understanding in Milton’s theodical and practical scientific approach to a proof of psyche and gender, in regard to the rationality of the Fall through Paradise Lost, will need to play a foundational inference point in understanding future obscure references to the female form. Acknowledgement of a corrupt female archetype in poetry will not encapsulate all reactions of poets’ alike, except vary in expression. Wyatt did render the image of himself as a pharmakon, that is a remedy, poison, and scapegoat, through the lens of the female form. And Donne, will traverse to find solace in a transitive object of the female form except pure, to rebalance harmony and sense. The dichotomy of Adam and Eve in regard to surveillance, induces panopticism. That as Adam intuitively must reiterate attention to Eve for the sake of the species continuum, Eve’s schematic, disciplines Adam into an orbit about her lense. Adam is thus in orbit of two objects simultaneously, God and Eve, hence evermore vexation and force into a pawn status.' },
    { id: 'w6', title: 'Metaphysical Analysis', categories: 'writing, college essay', subtext: '[metaphysical analysis]', prompt: 'Metaphysical poetry is resolutely individual in its focus, rather than social or collective. Discuss in relation to the work of at least two of the Metaphysical poets.', thesis: 'The argument in this research essay is to analyze the ‘becoming’, towards the inward portrait of the metaphysical poet; to focus upon the unique complexity of energy within the metaphysical poet, whose poetry contrast from the societal whole. ‘Becoming’ is a philosophical term in this sense, and defined to analyze the metaphysical poets’ process or framework of temporal nature and the nature of personal identity. Complexity in the metaphysical poet will mean paradoxes, polarities, and obscure gnarls and abstractions of thought.', image: metaphysicalAnalysisImage, paragraphOneTitle: 'Paradox', paragraphOneContents: 'Paradox by definition is a logical proposition that is seemingly sound or rational, yet leads conclusively to illogic and self-contradiction. As paradox intersects with a poet’s passions and correspondences, then a metaphysicality of the particular poet emerges. “Oh, to vex me, contraries meet in one” (a.); A poet in paradox, will forcefully have to seek, identify, and self-assess his or her unique complexity of energy, thus creating a new nether space affecting solely the individual. “Then as th’earths inward narrow crooked lanes” (b.); this new nether space of individuality will contrast from all society, that is people and social normalities.  Thus, the metaphysical poet will create a ‘bottom-up’ approach in poetry and narratives, seeking resolution of some alone paradox to illuminate a hypothesis or universal truth; rather than a ‘top-down’ approach, for example, Milton’s political papers which assess the societal collective. A creation of a complex inward portrait by the paradoxical poet, will intertwine with the chaotic emotion of love. Chaotic, in the idea that love can apex into martyrdom, or a passion to become a stigmatic. Intellect fusing with chaos will become the cerebrality of the metaphysical poet. Paradox will break boundaries of thought into vastness, and while deceive an existent path towards some resolution.', paragraphTwoTitle: 'Natural Symbolism', paragraphTwoContents: 'If the metaphysical poet is dwelling in some inward portrait, then the poet will have none other supreme foundation than nature. Thus, since nature being the central figure in the metaphysical poet’s realm, natural symbols are often found throughout the poet’s corpus as a central object. Often in metaphysical poetry, there is a strong aquatic symbol; water is a natural element conforming to any shape. In Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’, the metaphysical character Lear, personifies a tempest (torrential rains) to his being: “Thou think’st ‘tis much that this contentious storm / Invades us to the skin” (c.). As the cerebrality of the metaphysical poet is reflexive of nature, the poet is molding nature about his conscious and complexity with, directly or indirectly, thoughts of water. To pluralize this notion of strong aquatic symbolism amongst metaphysical poets’, meaning to not only reference Shakespeare, Donne and Herbert give exceptional aquatic notes as well: “...Th’ hydroptique drunkard, and night-scouting thiefe...” (d.), or, “...Powre new seas in mine eyes, that so I might Drowne my world with my weeping...” (e.), and, “...My grief hath need of all the watery things / That nature hath produced..." (f.). Often too, the metaphysical poet will reference his conscious or complexity of energy as a new world, “I am a little world made cunningly / Of Elements, and an Angelike spright” (g.). A poet’s referenced individual world will thoroughly contrast the poet from the societal whole; and with each complex, beautiful, and unique line of verse, solidifies the metaphysical poet’s world. “All the world’s a stage...” (h.); a theatre stage or play, being a framework from Shakespeare’s mind, is an obvious reflection of Shakespeare’s conscious and energy complexity and is referenced by Shakespeare as a world. “What if this present were the world’s last night?...” (i.); In this line, hence sonnet, Donne is physically in his verse transitioning the initial world into his world; that particular line being the first line in Holy Sonnet XIII, means Donne’s intent to waste no time in avoiding initial society in order to dwell in his conscious.', paragraphThreeTitle: 'The Flea', paragraphThreeContents: 'A significant and particular instance of a natural object becoming the central object in metaphysical poetry is a ‘flea’. “Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare” (j.); Donne equivocates the flea to the holy trinity, meaning the purity of the flea. Yet, Donne whom often in his corpus woes his sin: “But black sinne hath betraid to endlesse night / My worlds both parts, and (oh) both parts must die.” (k.), and, “And drowne in it my sinnes blacke memorie” (l.), sees the flea fusioning and nourishing from Donne’s said impure blood, thus Donne’s paradox, “Wherein could this flea guilty be, / Except in that drop which it sucked from thee? / Yet thou triumph’st” (m.). The metaphysicality is the poet’s obscure gnarls and abstractions upon an open object of nature; transitioning the ‘flea’ into his realm, yet creating a substantial hypothesis towards a universal wonder. A coherent, complex abstraction of an ordinary object is what will propel the poet as a unique entity in his or her world. An object such as the ‘flea’, is an object open to a myriad of observations, yet this can differentiate a metaphysical poet from any ordinary societal citizen. Any other person can see a flea as some petulant animal, some carrier for disease or virus, or to the strange, some vengeful thief. Except, the cerebrality of the metaphysical poet let the unassuming flea into his conscious and ponderance. The poet’s empathy with nature, has given an intertwinement to scientific hypothesis’ and poetry.', paragraphFourTitle: 'Framework', paragraphFourContents: 'Often in metaphysical poetry exists a meditative, religious lyric embedded in the text. Strong notions of  Catholicism appear in the corpus of poets such as Donne and Herbert: “Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell, The picture of Christ crucified” (n.), or, “Reversed thunder, Christ-side-piercing spear...Church bells beyond the stars heard, the soul’s blood” (o.). Theoretically, Catholicism is the exergy of the metaphysical poet. And the ultimate paradox being the concept of original sin; that a human creature of who initially was an image of God, initializes sin, and creates ancestral sin for all infants who would assume to be innocent. The metaphysical poet, in perpetuity, finds boundaries within regard to Christ’s salvation in order to defy original sin: “O Blessed glorious Trinity, / Bones to Philosophy...Give mee a such selfe different instinct / Of these; let all mee elemented bee, / Of power, to love, to know, you unnumbred three.” (p.); “My tender age in sorrow did begin: / And still with sicknesses and shame / Thou didst so punish sin...With thee / Let me combine, / And feel this day thy victory: For, / If I imp my wing on thine, / Affliction shall advance the flight in me” (q.). This moral framework will acute the metaphysical poets’ senses; of redemption towards reflecting God’s image, thus love and the intellect towards understanding the moral corollaries within Christ’s stigmata. This precision of sense through one moral framework will not encapsulate all metaphysical poets’ alike, except act as an optimal nourishment bed or an optical lense for the poet’s individual vital complexity to accel with.', paragraphFiveTitle: 'Civil War', paragraphFiveContents: 'A recurring theme sometimes throughout metaphysical poetry, is a type of polarity within the poet battling each other, “But ah! Thought kills me that I am not thought” (r.). “When senses, which thy souldiers are, / Wee arme against thee, and they fight for sinne, / When want, sent but to tame, doth warre / And worke despaire a breach to enter in” (s.); Donne is exclaiming a fight to defer temptation, within himself. Donne is calling his senses, souldiers, given the comparison to his senses as an organic militant force apart of his soul, yet Donne is wary to his senses as tainted with sin. Donne, in his perpetual quest to reflect God’s image through Christ’s salvation, has his senses acting as watch towers against the creeping notion of original sin. If the theory of Catholicism being the framework of the metaphysical poet stands then, this idea of trace polarity within the metaphysical poet may likely stem from Catholicism as well, since the poet sometimes attempts to emulate Christ: “Spit in my face you Jewes, and pierce my side, Buffet, and scoffe, scourge, and crucifie mee” (t.). The polarity in Christ is His clairvoyant love alongside clairvoyant hate, “But there are two vast spacious things, / The which to measure it doth more behove: / Yet few there are that sound them; Sinne and Love...Sinne is that presse and vice, which forceth pain / To hunt his cruell food through ev’ry vein.” (u.). “As humorous is my contritione / As my prophane Love, and as soone forgott: / As ridlingly distemper’d, cold and hott, / As praying, as mute; as infinite, as none.” (w.). This is a strong instance of polarity within the poet. These lines describe Donne as though trapped in a webbing of original sin despite worship, and lost in the paradox of ancestral sin.', paragraphSixTitle: 'Donne’s Emulation', paragraphSixContents: 'Donne gives this peculiar small description for his style of poetry: “Study me then, you who shall lovers bee / At the next world, that is, at the next Spring: / For I am every dead thing, / In whom love wrought new Alchimie. / For his art did expresse / A quintessence even from nothingnesse, / From dull privations, and leane emptinesse” (v.). All these particular lines of verse are all powerfully reminiscent of Christ’s stigmata. ‘At the next world…” translates to A.D. or after Christ’s death. “That is, at the next Spring...” translates to Easter or Christ’s resurrection. “For I am every dead thing, / In whom love wrought new Alchimie...” translates almost precisely to the stigmata. “A quintessence even from nothingnesse...”, a particular note of polarity, translates to the holy spirit or the ghost of Christ. “From dull privations, and leane emptinesse.” translates to Christ deceased on the cross. This idea of being a stigmatic, or emulation of Christ, is Donne’s intent to portal into the universe and harmonize with God. These lines of verse infer, that the process of emulating Christ is what inspires Donne’s poetry.', paragraphSevenTitle: 'Conclusion', paragraphSevenContents: 'Ultimately, the metaphysical poet is a singular object, and an embodiment of the universe encapsulated in small space.
