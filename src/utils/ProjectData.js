Gender and the female form will be the prime factor in Eve’s discerns thus ambitions, towards godhead and fall to temptation. Eve will be the archetype to the female form in ensuing readings of John Donne and Thomas Wyatt.', image: mazyErrorImage, paragraphOneTitle: 'In Utero', paragraphOneContents: 'Eve is the nurturer and nutrient to the continuity of the human race. A womb of nourishment and maternal instinct is what will differentiate Eve’s thought processes to Adam’s. Eve’s womb and maternal instinct is what will be impressed upon her as a creation of God, thus Eve’s mind will be vexed to understand if her oocytes are in gravitation towards God or Adam harnessing God. This vexing is evident as Eve finds temptation in a non-human creation of God equal to a phallic symbol, “O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear / To that false worm” (IX. 1067-1068). Adam gives a sort of warning to Eve of what direction to gravitate, “for nothing lovelier can be found / In woman, than to study household good, / And good works in her husband to promote.” (IX. 232-234); household can indeed equivocate to womb which houses an infant, as Adam is exclaiming to Eve to take care of herself and trust in her ‘husband’. Eve’s vexations continue after Eve eats the fruit, “shall I to him make known / As yet my change, and give him to partake / Full happiness with me, or rather not,” (IX. 817-819). “O fairest of creation, last and best / Of all God’s works, creature in whom excelled / Whatever can to sight or thought be formed” (IX. 896-898); In Adam’s dialog to Eve after eating the fruit, Milton leaves words very open to equivocation: “Whatever can to sight or thought be formed”. Adam could very well be identifying a creature in Eve, an oocyte and thus the utmost importance to the continuity of the species, as a work of God. And that Eve gave whatever thought to be formed as her choice to gravitate towards God over Adam, two patriarchal figures.', paragraphTwoTitle: 'Eve and Archetype to the Female Form', paragraphTwoContents: 'After Eve bites the fruit, Eve is in dialog with God and yet herself to, “O sovereign, virtuous, precious of all trees” (IX. 795). Eve has a very impassioned moment with God and herself, directly after eating the fruit, with intellectual insights and plots. Eve enters into some sort of scheming mode as to “dieted by thee I grow mature / In knowledge, as the gods”, and is yet ambitious to “keep the odds of knowledge in my power” void of Adam. Yet Eve resolves that, she will become useless thus extinct if she avoids Adam, “I extinct; / a death to think. Confirmed then I resolve, / Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe” (IX. 829-831). God as the ingenuity of Eve’s ovaries and maternal nature—gives Eve impulsive instincts, against God’s wishes, to be God’s associate sole yet needing Adam to survive. This schematic of Eve, hence female form, is reflexive to the female form in Sir Thomas Wyatt’s poem ‘They Flee From Me’: “To take bread at my hand; and now they range, / Busily seeking with a continual change.”. This idea of ‘taking bread at my hand’ can equivocate to her survival; a brief moment of touching then sudden range defines a tangential function, and is all similar to Eve’s schematic. This reference to a ‘mathematical tangent’ gives note, to the sinews of the female figure’s intellect.', paragraphThreeTitle: 'Surveillance', paragraphThreeContents: 'Eve will assume some righteous power upon Adam, whilst understanding the grave importance of her womb, as if holding her oocytes hostage for ransom to negotiate control, “so to add what wants / In female sex, the more to draw his love, And render me more equal, and perhaps, / A thing not undesirable, sometime / Superior” (IX. 821-825). Eve will want some type of governance upon Adam, as God does; this symmetry of behavior to God by Eve, to govern Adam, is evident as Eve wanting to be ‘rendered more equal’ meaning more symmetrical to God. This ‘becoming’ of the male figure to a pawn like state, gives surveillance to the male figure’s freedom perplexed. Adam is obliged by God to secure Eve and procure the human race, while Eve governs Adam as God does. “In thin array after a pleasant guise...Therewithall sweetly did me kiss / And softly said, “Dear heart, how like you this?””(10, 13-14); the female figure’s actions of intercourse, are in elevation to maintain relevance to God whilst utilizing control and surveillance tactics to govern. “But all is turned thorough my gentleness / Into a strange fashion of forsaking; / And I have leave to go of her goodness, / And she also, to use newfangleness.” (16-19). Wyatt’s temperance in ‘I have leave to go of her goodness’, sounds as though a submissive stance, to the goodness of procuring the species yet still a pawn to the female form. Wyatt’s concavity between a gentleness seduced towards the female form and an abrupt feeling of being forsaken, in the sake of ‘newfangleness’, is a tangential surveillance. Thomas Wyatt will identify the female figure’s sinful gravitation to God, as ‘newfangleness’. This box of surveillance and schematics will ultimately vex the male form and poet, rendering an image of escape, for instance: “This flea is you and I” (12).', paragraphFourTitle: 'Losse of Maidenhead', paragraphFourContents: '“And in this flea, our two bloods mingled bee; / Thou know’st that this cannot be said / A sinne, nor shame, nor losse of maidenhead,” (4-6); Donne notes the mechanical essence of the flea, hence not prone to vexation, as a comparison to the loss of maidenhead. Donne notes the intellectual vexations of the female form, in relation to sin. As Donne acquires an auxiliary free-object of which is non-human, to explore away from the female form, an erection occurs: “Yet this enjoyes before it wooe, / And pamper’d swells with one blood made of two,” (7-8); ‘pamper’d swells with one blood made of two’ will identify as an erection. This supreme anecdote, that escaping the female form would give Donne an erection, is insight to a new personal freedom. A personal freedom from the maidenhead governance, thus to escape the perpetuity of Eve’s sin, schematic, and surveillance. A flea alone acts tangentially, with hunting stratagem to seek blood, and infers a transitive property of the female form; yet, Donne will adorn the flea as since acting in respect to God. Donne finds affection to a creature of God acting tangentially, except legally, to cure his vexations of pondering the irregular tangent of the female, “’Tis true, then learne how false, feares bee; / Just so much honor, when thou yeeld’st to mee,” (25-26).', paragraphFiveTitle: 'Conclusion', paragraphFiveContents: 'Ultimately, Eve’s mental vexations to the patriarch of her oocytes induce ‘mazy error’. Eve’s idea to hold her oocytes hostage with ransom to govern Adam, “Of operation blessed / To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed, / And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end Created” (IX. 796-799), hath given complexity to Adam’s personal freedom of obliging God. An understanding in Milton’s theodical and practical scientific approach to a proof of psyche and gender, in regard to the rationality of the Fall through Paradise Lost, will need to play a foundational inference point in understanding future obscure references to the female form. Acknowledgement of a corrupt female archetype in poetry will not encapsulate all reactions of poets’ alike, except vary in expression. Wyatt did render the image of himself as a pharmakon, that is a remedy, poison, and scapegoat, through the lens of the female form. And Donne, will traverse to find solace in a transitive object of the female form except pure, to rebalance harmony and sense. The dichotomy of Adam and Eve in regard to surveillance, induces panopticism. That as Adam intuitively must reiterate attention to Eve for the sake of the species continuum, Eve’s schematic, disciplines Adam into an orbit about her lense. Adam is thus in orbit of two objects simultaneously, God and Eve, hence evermore vexation and force into a pawn status.' },
