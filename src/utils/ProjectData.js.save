Gender and the female form will be the prime factor in Eve’s discerns thus ambitions, towards godhead and fall to temptation. Eve will be the archetype to the female form in ensuing readings of John Donne and Thomas Wyatt.', image: mazyErrorImage, paragraphOneTitle: 'In Utero', paragraphOneContents: 'Eve is the nurturer and nutrient to the continuity of the human race. A womb of nourishment and maternal instinct is what will differentiate Eve’s thought processes to Adam’s. Eve’s womb and maternal instinct is what will be impressed upon her as a creation of God, thus Eve’s mind will be vexed to understand if her oocytes are in gravitation towards God or Adam harnessing God. This vexing is evident as Eve finds temptation in a non-human creation of God equal to a phallic symbol, “O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear / To that false worm” (IX. 1067-1068). Adam gives a sort of warning to Eve of what direction to gravitate, “for nothing lovelier can be found / In woman, than to study household good, / And good works in her husband to promote.” (IX. 232-234); household can indeed equivocate to womb which houses an infant, as Adam is exclaiming to Eve to take care of herself and trust in her ‘husband’. Eve’s vexations continue after Eve eats the fruit, “shall I to him make known / As yet my change, and give him to partake / Full happiness with me, or rather not,” (IX. 817-819). “O fairest of creation, last and best / Of all God’s works, creature in whom excelled / Whatever can to sight or thought be formed” (IX. 896-898); In Adam’s dialog to Eve after eating the fruit, Milton leaves words very open to equivocation: “Whatever can to sight or thought be formed”. Adam could very well be identifying a creature in Eve, an oocyte and thus the utmost importance to the continuity of the species, as a work of God. And that Eve gave whatever thought to be formed as her choice to gravitate towards God over Adam, two patriarchal figures.', paragraphTwoTitle: 'Eve and Archetype of the Female Form',},
